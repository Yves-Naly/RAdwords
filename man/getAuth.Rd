getAuth()
}
\value{
Client token from Google authentication server.
Dataframe with the credential information which is cached in working space 
and optionally saved as RData file in current working directory.

\description{
getAuth authenticates the R app at the Google authentication server using OAUTH2 and receives the client token.
Usually you need not to run getAuth() explicitly since the whole authentication process is managed by \code{\link{doAuth}}.
